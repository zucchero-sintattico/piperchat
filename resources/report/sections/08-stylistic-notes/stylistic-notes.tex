This is a very short paragraph.

This is a longer paragraph (notice the blank line in the code).
It composed by several sentences.
%
You're invited to use comments within \texttt{.tex} source files to separate sentences composing the same paragraph.

Paragraph should be logically atomic: a subordinate sentence from one paragraph should always refer to another sentence from within the same paragraph.

The first line of a paragraph is usually indented.
